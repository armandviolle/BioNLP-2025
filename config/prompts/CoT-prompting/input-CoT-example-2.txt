## Prompt step 1
Consider the following patient narrative:
I just wrote about my dad given multiple shots of lasciks after he was already so swelled his shin looked like it would burst open. Why would they give him so much. He was on oxygen and they took him off of the higher flow rate.

Answer to the patient's question using relevant information within the medical note below.

Acute diastolic heart failure: Pt developed signs and
symptoms of volume overload on \[**2201-3-8**] with shortness of breath,
increased oxygen requirement and lower extremity edema. Echo
showed preserved EF, no WMA and worsening AI. CHF most likely
secondary to worsening valvular disease. He was diuresed with
lasix IV, intermittently on lasix gtt then transitioned to PO
torsemide with improvement in symptoms, although remained on a
small amount of supplemental oxygen for comfort.
Respiratory failure: The patient was intubated for lethargy
and acidosis initially and was given 8 L on his presentation to
help maintain his BP's.  This undoubtedly contributed to his
continued hypoxemic respiratory failure.  He was advanced to
pressure support with stable ventilation and oxygenation. On
transfer to the CCU patient was still intubated but off
pressors. Patient was extubated successfully.  He was
reintubated \[**2201-3-1**] transiently for 48 hours for urgent TEE and
subsequently extubated without adverse effect or complication.

## Response step 1
It sounds like your dad was experiencing acute diastolic heart failure and was at risk for significant fluid overload. This is often seen in heart failure, where the heart struggles to pump effectively, leading to a buildup of fluid in the body. The swelling in his legs, especially in the shins, is a classic sign of this fluid retention. In his case, he also developed shortness of breath and required increased oxygen support.

To manage the volume overload, Lasix (furosemide), a diuretic, was used to help remove excess fluid from his system. The doses of Lasix were given intravenously (IV) and then transitioned to oral medication (torsemide), which is often done as the patient's condition improves. However, in cases of significant fluid retention like this, higher doses of Lasix may be required to effectively reduce the swelling and fluid buildup.

The oxygen therapy was likely adjusted due to the improvement in his respiratory condition after diuresis. Initially, he needed more oxygen to help manage his respiratory failure, but as his fluid balance improved, the need for higher flow rates decreased, allowing them to reduce the oxygen support.

In summary, the multiple doses of Lasix were given to manage the significant fluid overload, which was contributing to both the swelling and respiratory issues. The careful management of oxygen levels, alongside fluid reduction, helped stabilize his condition.

### Summary:

* **Lots of Lasix**: To treat severe fluid overload from heart failure.
* **Oxygen lowered**: Because his condition improved, not worsened.

These decisions are based on standard care for someone in his situation and were likely part of efforts to stabilize him. If anything felt unclear or abrupt in how this was explained to you at the time, it’s completely valid to want more clarification.

## Response step 3
Your dad developed fluid overload due to his heart condition, leading to swelling and difficulty breathing. To help, he was given Lasix, initially through IV and then switched to oral torsemide, which improved his symptoms. Oxygen levels were adjusted as his condition stabilized, reducing the need for higher flow rates. The diuretic therapy, along with managing his oxygen, played a key role in improving both the swelling and his breathing issues |2,5,6|.
